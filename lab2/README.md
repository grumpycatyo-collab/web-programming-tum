# Emotional Support Bricks

WE SELL SUPPORT BRICKS. SO WHAT?

## Description

Emotional Support Bricks is a support for everyone. You want to touch something? Feel the warmth of the soil or the cold of the rocks? We are here for you and your hurt soul.
You know how Toni Braxton would say - Un-break My Heart! Our bricks (especially the marble one) does that on an extensive measure without any hesitation. We even had an idea to 
design the Brick +, for the gym buddies, be like Rock Lee, you know? If you drop that brick, it would create a hole in the time space continuum.
So don't hesitate to buy a brick from us. We make them with clay!
